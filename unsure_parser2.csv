I would never have expected that I could be so deceived. This is not the first time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure ""Over the rainbow"" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of your most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or shouldn't be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourite singers, whose career I have been following from the beginning, and Danny Brook never appears, and nobody gives any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one could do instead. Even playing some music to help us take it easy would have been better than nothing! No announcement, no | invitation...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment on that point. That terrible place definitely needed refurbishment.

I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same as last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well in this musical. Then I was sat with my friend just waiting for the start and that lasted forever and it was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I intended to go to the restaurant, which | occasionally was closed. By this time I thought: ""I want my money back."" What was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen.
