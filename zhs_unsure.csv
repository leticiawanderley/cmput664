You must wonder why I'm writing to you, then! ... Well actually we've just received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we | quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, admission is free for the students so that won't raise the cost of the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were going shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind!
