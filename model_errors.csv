FN,AGN,"Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology.

Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their | life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off. Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner. He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"". In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life. ","Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology. To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food. Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their | lives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off. Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner. He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"". In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life. "
