I am always available on my mobile phone, which is also boring sometimes! Being on an apprenticeship, I go to both work and university. At the university, I have studied with computer-aided systems.

RA,RP,"The hotel I booked is the Palace Hotel which is in the centre of London just two blocks from Victoria station. I think it is very convenient for the group. | you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. About the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. The rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. And the best way to get to the College for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to Glouster Road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the College. However I am going to make a plan for each student with all of the details and the address.

RP,RA,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the only reason why she had not got a lot of friends.
