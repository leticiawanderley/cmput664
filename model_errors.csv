RJ,DJ,"As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction as each masterpiece is unique in its own way regardless of what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand our own life and the people around us better. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world's treasure house of literature and arouses an | irresistable fascination.

We | lay on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volleyball matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing at me. So I took the decision to go and join them as well though I knew that it would be dangerous for my life . I waded very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends would realize that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided to take up swimming, so that I would have no embarrassments on future trips to the seaside . "

First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I became very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It was supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because the advertisement for the show said that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, the advertisement said that the theatre restaurant was open but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the the restaurant chef was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, otherwise, I | will have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, "
FN,RN,"I'm sorry to be writing to you about such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you advertised: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage! By the way, what really upset me was the starting time. According to your advertisement it started at 19:30, and , what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost, which was from £10 to £20, but despite what I thought I had to pay £20 without any other | chance. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visiting the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me.
