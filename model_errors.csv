The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set up the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthwhile for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you.
