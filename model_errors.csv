On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't compulsory. We aren't allowed to smoke or drink any alcohol.

RT,ID,"I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always | on the search for answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"".

RY,S,"Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by | rapdily developing modern technology. To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food. Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off. Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner. He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"". In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves.

Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off. Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner. He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"". In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life. "

UN,RN,"""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very accurate summary in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil ways. He's the richest character of all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason for whatever happens to the other characters. They are always suffering from the vengeance that Heathcliff is sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other characters have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated for his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this | trend to harm but because the other characters have made him like that. This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important aspect of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.

We would like to ask you if there is any chance of getting our money back or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience ? We are looking forward to hearing from you.

RJ,DJ,"""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" First of all, ""daily life"" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. As recently as two years ago, I was working with a notebook or diary, and I used to use a wired phone system. Nowadays, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that allows me to connect to the Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get information and electronic mail. I am always available on my mobile phone, which is also boring sometimes! Being on an apprenticeship, I go to both work and university. At the university, I have studied with computer-aided systems. I often go on the Internet to find information when studying a particular subject more closely (university technology sites). At work my particular job involves two standard PCs with | specifical software plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a special computer that my firm is now developing. At home, I have got a personal computer for my mail and accounts, and electronic mail plus the Internet for keeping in touch with my friends who are on the other side of France or Germany, Korea and so on.

Apart from that, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain to me the reasons for such a huge delay? Thirdly, the ad mentioned possible discounts. Personally speaking, I didn't see them and didn't even hear of them: I asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovation! How can you dare publish an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know it is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize the fact that I did not have a ""perfect evening out"" at all, such as was | mentioned in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, you to give me my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, "

There I met with many problems. First of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the time of the performance was 9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up with waiting. The worst thing of all was that at the beginning of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised. They were worse than the previous actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious because of all this. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am really annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give us back us money because everything that you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope to get your answer soon.

After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I was not able to eat anything either. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guided tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I realised that they were very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they gave a great performance.

The time of the beginning of the show was written as half past two p.m. and half past seven that evening, again. Lack of time made me go to the evening show.

Another problem - in the advertisement it was definitely written that there were some | of the discounts on the tickets. No, alas, in reality it appeared to be a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown.
